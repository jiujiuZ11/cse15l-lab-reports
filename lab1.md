## 1.The 'cd' Command
### a. With No Arguments
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ 
```
**Working Directory: /home**  
Having no arguments for command implies that the command is executed with its default behavior or settings.
There is no direct output. Running cd with no arguments takes you to your home directory.   
No error.
### b. With a Directory Path argument
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ pwd
/home/lecture1
```
**Working Directory: /home/lecture1**  
"With a directory path argument" means I'm providing a specific directory location in the filesystem to that command. This directory location informs the command where to operate or what to act upon. In this case, lecture1.  
There is no direct output but the command navigates to the lecture1 directory from the current working directory.  
No error.
