# Part 2 – Reflection
During the second half of this quarter, I learned about Vim. Initially introduced through the vimtutor, I found Vim's modal editing - separating the tasks of inserting text and manipulating text - both challenging and fascinating. It was a departure from the typical text editors I was accustomed to. Despite recognizing Vim's potential for efficiency, I still need more practiced. I often found myself fumbling with commands, which highlighted the vast difference between Vim and the editors I was accustomed to.
